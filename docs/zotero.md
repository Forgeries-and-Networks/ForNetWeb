# Project bibliography and links

## Zotero library

The ForNet team has created a [ZOTERO library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5523825/fornet/library) in which we share our own project publications as well as related literature and the metadata of sources we have used for the project.

Please note that the library is under construction until the end of the funding period and that its current state is a work in progress.
